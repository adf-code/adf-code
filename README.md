# 👋 Hi, I’m Arief

I enjoy building things that work at scale — especially in **digital identity**, **mobile apps**, and **liveness anti-spoofing**.  
Along the way, I’ve learned a lot from open source, and I try to give back whenever I can.

### 🧩 What I Work On

- Helping improve digital onboarding experiences — from mobile login to fraud detection.
- Building backend systems using **Go**, **Python**, **gRPC**, **RabbitMQ**, and **PostgreSQL**.
- Exploring face anti-spoofing models like **CNN**, **CDCN**, and **PRNet**.
- Leading technical improvements that save cloud costs and simplify testing with **BDD**.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Backend**: Golang, Python, gRPC, WebSocket, RabbitMQ  
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, PRNet, CDCN, Liveness Detection  
- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js, Next.js 
- **Infra**: Kubernetes, Docker, GCP, Firestore, PostgreSQL  
- **Automation**: pytest-bdd, Gherkin, CI/CD pipelines  
- **Monitoring**: Jira Dashboards, Custom Gadgets

### 🔍 Things I Explore in My Free Time

I like tinkering with open source projects that mix research and real-world usage, especially around face and depth modeling.

| Project | What I Like About It |
|--------|----------------------|
| [PRNet](https://github.com/yfeng95/PRNet) | Fun way to learn about 3D face reconstruction |
| [CDCN](https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN) | Great intro to depth-aware liveness detection |
| [Face Anti-Spoofing Papers](https://github.com/ZitongYu/Face-Anti-Spoofing.Papers) | Useful collection of ideas and references |

### 💬 A Bit More About Me

- I started with IoT projects and gradually moved into web, mobile, and cloud systems.
- I’ve helped scale apps to hundreds of thousands of users.
- I enjoy simplifying complex systems and learning by doing.
