### 🔍 I Love Doing Research With

I love learning from and experimenting with research-based open source projects, especially in the area of **face anti-spoofing** and **3D face modeling**. A few projects I admire and explore:

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [PRNet](https://github.com/yfeng95/PRNet) | Deep 3D Face Reconstruction |
| [CDCN](https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN) | Central Difference Convolution for Anti-Spoofing |
| [Face Anti-Spoofing Papers](https://github.com/ZitongYu/Face-Anti-Spoofing.Papers) | Great resource for staying up to date on liveness detection |
