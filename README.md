# 👋 Hi, I’m Arief

🎯 I build impactful tech products with a strong focus on **Digital Identity**, **Liveness Anti-Spoofing**, and **Secure Cloud Systems** — and I learn a lot from open source.

---

### 🧠 What I’ve Been Building (2016–2025)

- 🔐 Built systems for **Digital ID**, **On-Premise Digital Signatures**, and **OAuth2 Login (OIDC)** used by 5+ enterprise clients.
- 📲 Boosted mobile app user growth by 100% with feature revamps and better user experience.
- 🧪 Developed **Liveness Anti-Spoofing Detection** using CNN, CDCN, and PRNet in Python.
- 📊 Created dashboards and BDD automation tests that reduced manual QA by 50%.
- ☁️ Reduced cloud infra cost by 30% and monitoring tool cost by 60%.
- 📦 Architected real-time systems with **Golang**, **gRPC**, **RabbitMQ**, and **WebSocket**.
- 📡 Implemented IoT-based city lighting and energy monitoring systems using STM32.

### 🔍 I Love Doing Research With

I love learning from and experimenting with research-based open source projects, especially in the area of **face anti-spoofing** and **3D face modeling**. A few projects I admire and explore:

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [PRNet](https://github.com/yfeng95/PRNet) | Deep 3D Face Reconstruction |
| [CDCN](https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN) | Central Difference Convolution for Anti-Spoofing |
| [Face Anti-Spoofing Papers](https://github.com/ZitongYu/Face-Anti-Spoofing.Papers) | Great resource for staying up to date on liveness detection |
